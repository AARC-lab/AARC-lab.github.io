  description: "Designing and validating controllers for connected and automated vehicles\
    \ to enhance traffic flow presents significant challenges, from the complexity\
    \ of replicating real-world stop-and-go traffic dynamics in simulation, to the\
    \ intricacies involved in transitioning from simulation to actual deployment.\
    \ In this work, we present a full pipeline from data collection to controller\
    \ deployment. Specifically, we collect 772 km of driving data from the I-24 in\
    \ Tennessee, and use it to build a one-lane simulator, placing simulated vehicles\
    \ behind real-world trajectories. Using policy-gradient methods with an asymmetric\
    \ critic, we improve fuel efficiency by over 10% when simulating congested scenarios.\
    \ Our comprehensive approach includes reinforcement learning for controller training,\
    \ software verification, hardware validation and setup, and navigating various\
    \ sim-to-real challenges. Furthermore, we analyze the controller's behavior and\
    \ wave-smoothing properties, and deploy it on four Toyota Rav4\u2019s in a real-world\
    \ validation experiment on the I-24. Finally, we release the driving dataset (Nice\
    \ et al., 2021), the simulator and the trained controller (Lichtl\xE9 et al.,\
    \ 2022), to enable future benchmarking and controller design."

  description: Cyber-physical power systems, such as grids, integrate computational
    and communication components with physical systems to introduce novel functions
    and improve resilience and fault tolerance. These systems employ computational
    components and real-time controllers to meet power demands. Microgrids, comprising
    interconnected components, energy resources within defined electrical boundaries,
    computational elements, and controllers, offer a solution for integrating renewable
    energy sources and ensuring resilience in electricity demand. Simulating these
    cyber-physical systems (CPS) is vital for grid design, as it facilitates the modeling
    and control of both continuous physical processes and discrete-time power converters
    and controllers. This paper presents a model-based design tool for simulating
    cyber-physical power systems, including microgrids, using SystemC-AMS. The adoption
    of SystemC-AMS enables physical modeling with both native components from the
    SystemC-AMS library and user-defined computational elements. We observe that SystemC-AMS
    can accurately produce the electromagnetic transient responses essential for analyzing
    grid stability. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SystemC-AMS
    through use cases that simulate grid-following inverters. Comparing the SystemC-AMS
    implementation to one in Simulink reveals that SystemC-AMS offers a more rapid
    simulation. A design tool like this could support microgrid designers in making
    informed decisions about the selection of microgrid components prior to installation
    and deployment.

  description: "Microgrids are localized power systems that can function independently\
    \ or alongside the main grid. They consist of interconnected generators, energy\
    \ storage, and loads that can be managed locally. Using SystemC-AMS, we demonstrate\
    \ how microgrid components, including solar panels and converters, can be accurately\
    \ modeled and simulated, along with their interactions. Real-time simulations\
    \ are crucial for understanding microgrid behavior and optimizing components.\
    \ This approach facilitates seamless integration with hardware prototypes and\
    \ automation systems, supporting various development stages. Our study presents\
    \ a best-case scenario for real-time simulation, assuming each loop takes less\
    \ time than the simulation time step, with fallback to the previous value if data\
    \ isn\u2019t received in time. This article introduces the first known real-time\
    \ simulation strategy using SystemC-AMS, enabling the real-time simulation of\
    \ microgrid components and integration with external devices. The implementation\
    \ adopts a model-based design approach, creating increasingly complex systems\
    \ with grid components and controllers."

  description: The use of pre-shared entanglement in entanglement-assisted communication
    offers a superior alternative to classical communication, especially in the photon-starved
    regime and highly noisy environments. In this paper, we analyze the performance
    of several low-complexity receivers that use optical parametric amplifiers. The
    simulations demonstrate that receivers employing an entanglement-assisted scheme
    with phase-shift-keying modulation can outperform classical capacities. We present
    a 2x2 optical hybrid receiver for entanglement-assisted communication and show
    that it has a roughly 10% lower error probability compared to previously proposed
    optical parametric amplifier-based receivers for more than 10 modes. However,
    the capacity of the optical parametric amplifier-based receiver exceeds the Holevo
    capacity and the capacities of the optical phase conjugate receiver and 2x2 optical
    hybrid receiver in the case of a single mode. The numerical findings indicate
    that surpassing the Holevo and Homodyne capacities does not require a large number
    of signal-idler modes. Furthermore, we find that using unequal priors for BPSK
    provides roughly three times the information rate advantage over equal priors.

  description: This paper describes a lightweight runtime architecture for telemetry,
    communication, and control of cars deployed with advanced driver assistance systems
    where a human is in the loop with the car, via an LTE connection. The system architecture
    supports both local control decisions based on car sensors and safety algorithms
    as well as high-level input from external systems that may provide insight into
    traffic state ahead of sensor data. Implementation of the architecture is done
    in ROS and depends on open-source software packages for runtime decoding of information
    from the vehicle's controller area network (CAN) and integration of GPS data from
    accompanying sensors. The contribution of the paper is to describe the overall
    architecture, the data it can communicate to other systems, performance of the
    system at runtime, and challenges faced when deploying the architecture across
    a heterogeneous fleet. Preliminary results from analysis of test data will provide
    insights into whether the use of high-latency communication can be effective for
    societal-scale intelligent transportation systems when applied in future scenarios.

  description: "This paper describes the software design patterns and vehicle interfaces\
    \ that were employed to transition vehicle controllers from simulation environments\
    \ to open-road field experiments. The approach relies on a life cycle that utilizes\
    \ model-based design and code generation, along with agile software development,\
    \ and both software- and hardware-in-the-loop testing, with additional safety\
    \ margins. Autonomous designs should consider the dynamics of mixed autonomy in\
    \ traffic to safely operate among humans. The software that provides a vehicle\u2019\
    s behavior intelligence is often developed through simulation, which may have\
    \ a mismatch between dynamics, or as a result of a reinforcement learning workflow,\
    \ which may be a black box with challenges to analyze. In each of these cases,\
    \ it is important to have research interfaces that provide strongly typed data\
    \ streams accessible to researchers who are not software experts while continuing\
    \ to satisfy safety and liveness constraints. This paper describes how we design\
    \ the hardware platform interfaces and software design process for a mixed autonomy\
    \ traffic experiment with a leader-follower scenario. Controller synthesis for\
    \ these vehicles requires clearly articulated vehicle interfaces and software\
    \ design patterns for successful onboard deployment. Testing strategies for such\
    \ controllers are also described before algorithms are transitioned to full-scale\
    \ field experiments with safety operators for the vehicles. Testing strategies\
    \ include software-in-the-loop simulation testing, hardware-in-the-loop simulation,\
    \ ghost-car testing, and read-only testing in live traffic. With our approach,\
    \ we were not only able to validate our controller synthesized in scripts and\
    \ simulation, but also able to scale deployment to multiple vehicles."

  description: This paper introduces a parameter estimation approach for decoding
    digital sensor signals in a cyber-physical system. For unknown or not fully characterized
    digital sensor data, it can be difficult to decipher a desired signal from background
    or noise. In a cyber-physical system with networked sensors, we can leverage knowledge
    of the physical system to inform the decoding of the digital signals. This work
    in progress is a case study on deciphering commercial vehicle on-board sensor
    networks that communicate through the Controller Area Network (CAN). By understanding
    the stock vehicle sensor network, a vehicle can be extended into a scalable research
    platform with minimal instrumentation. Our challenge was to localize desired sensor
    signals encoded in network traffic that included other sensor data, control messages,
    as well as encoding and security overhead. Due to the vehicle's unknown sensor
    network, our approach developed methods to efficiently analyze and identify key
    signals despite the large state-space for potential signal embeddings. The contribution
    of this work-in-progress is a formal approach to deciphering pertinent signals
    uncharacterized cyber-physical system, with a case study in using this approach
    in vehicle on-board sensor networks. We share a code repository with analysis
    tools for analyzing digital signals.

  description: "Single-cell data analysis has been at forefront of development in\
    \ biology and medicine since sequencing data have been made available. An important\
    \ challenge in single-cell data analysis is the identification of cell types.\
    \ Several methods have been proposed for cell-type identification. However, these\
    \ methods do not capture the higher-order topological relationship between different\
    \ samples. In this work, we propose an attention-based graph neural network that\
    \ captures the higher-order topological relationship between different samples\
    \ and performs transductive learning for predicting cell types. The evaluation\
    \ of our method on both simulation and publicly available datasets demonstrates\
    \ the superiority of our method, scAGN, in terms of prediction accuracy. In addition,\
    \ our method works best for highly sparse datasets in terms of F1 score, precision\
    \ score, recall score, and Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficients as well. Further,\
    \ our method\u2019s runtime complexity is consistently faster compared to other\
    \ methods."
