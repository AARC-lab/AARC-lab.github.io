  description: Cyber-physical power systems, such as grids, integrate computational
    and communication components with physical systems to introduce novel functions
    and improve resilience and fault tolerance. These systems employ computational
    components and real-time controllers to meet power demands. Microgrids, comprising
    interconnected components, energy resources within defined electrical boundaries,
    computational elements, and controllers, offer a solution for integrating renewable
    energy sources and ensuring resilience in electricity demand. Simulating these
    cyber-physical systems (CPS) is vital for grid design, as it facilitates the modeling
    and control of both continuous physical processes and discrete-time power converters
    and controllers. This paper presents a model-based design tool for simulating
    cyber-physical power systems, including microgrids, using SystemC-AMS. The adoption
    of SystemC-AMS enables physical modeling with both native components from the
    SystemC-AMS library and user-defined computational elements. We observe that SystemC-AMS
    can accurately produce the electromagnetic transient responses essential for analyzing
    grid stability. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SystemC-AMS
    through use cases that simulate grid-following inverters. Comparing the SystemC-AMS
    implementation to one in Simulink reveals that SystemC-AMS offers a more rapid
    simulation. A design tool like this could support microgrid designers in making
    informed decisions about the selection of microgrid components prior to installation
    and deployment.
